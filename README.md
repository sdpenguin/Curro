# Curro
A program to assist with recording revents for wa

N.B. This program only currently works with the revent_workload_old branch of Sdpenguin's workload-automation on Github.
This is because a new version was created conforming to WA's method of working (workload oriented) that removes support for 
custom naming among other things.
