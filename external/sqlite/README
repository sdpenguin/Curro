For WA we use a slightly modified version of sqlite3 so that it can
be built statically. We used the amalgamated sqlite3 version 3.12.2.
which is under the public domain.

https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

Build command:
gcc shell.c sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl -static -O2 -fPIC -DPIC  -DSQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION

You will need to apply the diff in static.patch
